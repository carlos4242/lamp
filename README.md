I'm fairly horrified or pleased to realise I started this project nearly three years ago!

The arduino sketch runs a simple webserver and the suite of apps connect to it and in response to
switches being flipped, perform various web service calls.

It needs some cleanup and has the occasional bug.  Any contributions greatly appreciated!

See the [blog post](https://petosoft.wordpress.com/2015/05/03/homebrew-lights-in-my-flat-controlled-by-arduino-and-apple-watch/) for how I constructed the hardware.

Good luck!
